# AirportDetection
Extract airport objects in remote sensing images using saliency analysis and active contour model

This project is an implementation of the following paper: 
Q. Zhang, L. Zhang, W. Shi and Y. Liu, 
"Airport Extraction via Complementary Saliency Analysis and Saliency-Oriented Active Contour Model," 
in IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters, vol. 15, no. 7, pp. 1085-1089, July 2018.

We also provide some successful data samples (100 images with 600*600 pixels) 

If you use our project for academic purposes, please cite the paper above.
